# Set bounds for feasible near-term carbon capture development

# Note: Because the variable "Carbon Capture" was not consistently reported directly in
# legacy projects, the criteria are also applied to "Carbon Capture|Geological Storage",
# which was reported as "Carbon Capture|CCS" in the AR6 database
